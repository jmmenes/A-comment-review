# A-comment-review

Using the file below, comment on most of the code explaining what they do. When you're finished, make a github repo called commented-work. Then push up and submit the link to the WDI-202 assignment called A-comment-review on Monday. You won't be able to submit earlier than Monday! Thank You.
